### Author
Hi my name is Mick Holster and I am a student at Avans Hogeschool Breda where I currently study Computer Science.

### Project
This project was an assigment from my school to learn JavaScript. This API can modify, delete and create users and meals. Authorization is built within the program using JWT tokens. So after logging in you will recieve a token generated by JWT. With that token you can create your own meals and modifiy/delete them. Only you can update and delete your own meals. Have fun!
